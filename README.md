This is a dashboard I created for my personal consumption but I believe anyone can find it insightful, educative and helpful.

## What you would find?
- Codes for taking data from [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)
- Data cleaning, preprocessing and feature creation
- Codes for making the dashboard

## How to run this on your machine?
Before following any of the steps below please ensure you have installed all the libraries in the [requirement.txt file](https://github.com/francisatoyebi/corona-bokeh/blob/master/requirements.txt)
1. Run the [preparing notebook](https://github.com/francisatoyebi/corona-bokeh/blob/master/Preparing.ipynb) in jupyter
2. Open your command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the codes
3. Run the command "bokeh serve --show myapp.py"
